micabytes/lib_game is primarily the work of:
- Michael Akinde, MicaByte Systems

Individual solutions have been inspired from many sources, not least the good
people of the Stackoverflow community.

The BitmapSurfaceRenderer solution to handling large images owes a great
debt to the project by John Lombardo, johnnylambada/WorldMap.
